# Structural Results for Maximal Quaternion Orders and Connecting Ideals of Prime Power Norm in $B_{p,\infty}$

This is a copy of the code for the paper [Structural Results for Maximal Quaternion Orders and Connecting Ideals of Prime Power Norm in $B_{p,\infty}$](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/033) which is also available [here](https://github.com/jtcc2/structural-results-for-quaternion-orders-and-ideals).

Where the proofs required rather long linear algebra calculations/relations, which were too long to list in full in the paper, these files contain the full lists of relations in an easily verifiable format.
