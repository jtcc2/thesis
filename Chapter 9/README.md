# Chapter 9: Open Questions

The algorithm of Section 9.1 for finding quaternion $\ell$-ideal paths is given in file `ideal_path.ipynb`.

The code to generate the figures of quadratic embedding probabilities in Section 9.2, is given in `embed_prob.ipynb`.

Both files use some utility functions, which are contained in `utils.sage`.
For example this includes code for the algorithm solving the quaternion embedding problem from Chapter 4.
