# Chapter 8: New Tools for SageMath

The isogeny database described in Section 8.1, is not contained within the repository but can be found [here](https://github.com/jtcc2/isogeny-database-with-end-rings).

The code for computing isogeny volcano rims as described in Section 8.2, is given in file `oriented_isogeny_volcano_rims.ipynb`.

The implementation of the quaternion algebra isomorphism algorithm of Section 8.3 is given in file `quatalg_iso.ipynb`.
