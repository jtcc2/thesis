# Algorithms for Finding Orientations of Supersingular Elliptic Curves and Quaternion Orders.

This is a copy of the code for the paper [Finding Orientations of Supersingular Elliptic Curves and Quaternion Orders](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1268) which is also available [here](https://github.com/jtcc2/finding-orientations).
See the paper for the list of authors.  

It includes:

A brute force algorithm for solving the $\mathfrak{O}$-Orienting problem - Given a curve $E$ which can be oriented by a quadratic order $\mathfrak{O}$, find the orientation.

The code is explained with examples in the jupyter notebook file.
