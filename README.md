# Code for PhD Thesis

This repository contains the code referred to in my PhD thesis. The code for each chapter has a separate folder, within which you can find a README describing its contents.

All code is written for use with [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/), and should work in SageMath version 10.3 or later.
